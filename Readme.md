# First things first  - created a hono app and moved from there.

# secondly figured out the routes and implemented.

# Then we define schemas of our db using prisma.

# Then using prisma accelarate we defined a connection pooling in our app.

# We wrote the logic of our backend.

# Then we defined routes which could be done earlier.

# we assigned jwt to the user using hono jwt.

# Defined middlewares.

# we did zod verification then by creating a common folder and publishing this code to
# packages to use it as a dependency both in frontend or backend, this now can be done 
# using monorepo.
